% Why SECD and Lisp? 


The SECD machine is deeply linked with the [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECD_machine) programming language. Lisp is among the oldest programming languages still in use today; originating in 1958, it predates C by 14 years. Lisp's syntax is significantly different from most popular programming languages, and many programmers consider it arcane or confusing. 

Why, then, focus on Lisp and on an abstract machine inspired by Lisp, when other languages are newer and more popular?

In anthropology, the [Sapir-Whorf hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) suggests that the syntactical structure of a human language effects the thought patterns of the individuals who speak and write it. While not all linguists and anthropologists agree that this is true of natural languages, I for one feel that it is certainly true of _programming_ languages. The syntax of a programming language shapes the cognitive structures of programmers using that language, and teaches its own ways of solving programming problems.
