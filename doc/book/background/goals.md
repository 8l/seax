% Goals

While the Seax project was undertaken primarily for purposes of education and exploration, I have endeavoured to create a platform that could be used for the execution of non-trivial programs in the 'real world' or, barring that, a prototype that can easily be scaled up to such a system. This objective has informed Seax design and development at every possible occasion, and a majority of the project's more specific goals are extrapolated from it.

Seax VM as a general-purpose platform for program execution
-----------------------------------------------------------

Although the Seax Scheme compiler is the only extant programming language targeting the Seax Virtual Machine, an emphasis has been placed on ensuring that it may eventually be used as a platform for multiple programming languages. If the Seax VM is only capable of effectively executing Scheme programs, then it is not a runtime environment for programming languages as much as it is an unnecessarily complex Scheme interpreter, so it is important that an effort be made to ensure compatibility.

One of the greatest lessons taught to us by Java, in my opinion, is that a simple VM performs excellently as a common runtime environment for programs written in a variety of languages. Programmers may complain about the wordiness and general inelegance of the Java language's syntax, but the Java _platform_ plays host to a wide range of excellent languages, including Scala, Groovy, and Clojure. Oracle and Sun have both poured a great deal of engineering effort into [optimizing the JVM's performance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_performance#Virtual_machine_optimization_techniques) to the extent that it is comparable to native code in many cases, and (amazingly), occasionally even [better](http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/java.html#faster-programs-measurements), and all of the languages that run on the Java platform can benefit from these improvements. Furthermore, all of these languages may take advantage of the JVM's cross-platform capabilities, and of the very large ecosystem of Java libraries and frameworks.
