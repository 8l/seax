% Why Rust?

Seax is written using the [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org) programming language. As far as programming languages go, Rust is very young &mdash; version 1.0 of Rust was released earlier this year. Since the language is so young, the astute reader would be likely to assume (not incorrectly) that Rust is likely to be very unstable.

Why, then, have I chosen to use such a young and unstable language for my implementation of Seax? What benefits does Rust provide that make up for the difficulties of working with a bleeding-edge language?
