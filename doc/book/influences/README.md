No software system can truly be said to be wholly original; like all creative works, computer programs exist only due to their historical antecedants and infleunces. Seax is greatly indebted to the work of many of computing's greatest pioneers, including Peter J. Landin; Tom Knight, David Moon, and Jack Holloway; Guy L. Steele, Jr and Gerald Sussman; and James Gosling.  take a great deal of pride in drawing ideas and inspiration from the work of these brilliant researchers. 

In this section, I will briefly enumerate some of the particular publications and software systems that have provided the greatest influence on Seax. In addition to providing credit where it is greatly deserved, highlighting these previous works is one of the most effective ways to teach the interested reader about Seax. The reader who is interested to use Seax as a tool, or to contribute to its ongoing development, would do well to consult some of these works, taking the ideas from the proverbial horse's mouth.
